# WakeCup

Welcome to my HTML/CSS Project called WakeCup, this is for one of my class projects.
I have used pure HTML with no Bootstrap.

How to use:

Click on any of the html files, or in vscode, click the "go live" button with the live extension. You can click on any page and it is responsive for phones, but it is only the UI so there is no back-end design.
